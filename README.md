This project is a simple C# library called "Animals". It contains a number of classes which represents species of animals and interfaces which defines common behavioral characteristics. Each class encapsulates specific properties and behaviors which are unique to its art. Such behaviors are variations of the ability to produce sounds and species specific information about that particular animal.

The library includes documentation and validation of input parameters to assert robustness and clarity. Furthermore, it implements an interface for person like behavior, which extends the context beyond tradional representations of animalistic species.

This repository serves as a useful resource in learning about how object oriented programming principles can be useful in representing animals and be a starting point in educational c# projects.
